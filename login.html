<!--
Requirements:
• Create a login page with HTML.
• Include a form with fields for username and password
-->

<!--
Place the following elements in your HTML at these specific locations and do not change the
order:
• <header>: This is where your website's logo and name should be placed. The logo should
be placed at the left and name should be placed right after the logo.
• <div>: The navigation links to other pages (home.html, products.html, contact.html, and
login.html) are placed directly below the header.
• <main>: Below the navigation bar, where the login form, including username, password
fields, and a "Login" button, should be placed. This button will not have any functionality
at this moment. Password should be masked. You also need to include a link to sign up
page for new users. Do not need to create a web page for signup at this point.
• <footer>: Add a footer with a copyright notice at the bottom of your page.
