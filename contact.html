<!--
Requirements:
• Create a contact page with HTML.
• Display contact information, such as email, phone number, and social media links. You do
not need to put your personal social media profile’s link. Alternatively, you can redirect the
user to facebook.com or instagram.com
-->

<!--
Place the following elements in your HTML at these specific locations and do not change the
order:
• <header>: This is where your website's logo and name should be placed. The logo should
be placed at the left and name should be placed right after the logo.
• <div>: The navigation links to other pages (home.html, products.html, contact.html, and
login.html) are placed directly below the header.
• <main>: Below the navigation bar, where the contact information should be displayed. This
page must contain a message to the customers, email, phone number, and at least 2 social
media links. When the user clicks on a link, they will be redirected to the social media
website associated with that link.
• <footer>: Add a footer with a copyright notice at the bottom of your page.
